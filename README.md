# wandering-ghost-game

# Overview
## Players are trapped in a maze; their field of view is limited, and they must find their way through the maze to the exit before their time runs out. The goal is to collect as many points as possible (red squares) while traversing the maze, and the more squares the player collects, the higher the ending score.

# Technical Specification
## 1. Architecture
### Key Components
1. **Main**: Manages game state, level progression, score, and gameplay loop.
2. **Map**: Manages room generation, entrances, exits, and secret rooms based on preset layouts.
3. **Player**: Represents the playerâ€™s ghost with movement and interaction capabilities.


### 1. GameScene Class (main.js)
Main game scene handling core game logic and state.

**Properties:**
- `player` - Player instance
- `cursor` - Keyboard input handler
- `fires` - Collected point counter
- `textScore` - Score display text
- `textTime` - Timer display text
- `timedEvent` - Game timer
- `coinMusic` - Sound effect for collection
- `bgMusic` - Background music (unused)
- `emitter` - Particle effect system
- `gameMap` - GameMap instance

**Methods:**
- `preload()` - Loads game assets
- `create()` - Sets up game world and objects
- `update()` - Handles game loop updates
- `collectFire(player, fire)` - Handles fire collection logic
- `gameOver(won)` - Handles game end conditions


### 2. Player Class (player.js)
Handles player sprite creation and movement mechanics.
**Properties:**
- `scene` - Reference to the game scene
- `sprite` - Physical player sprite object
- `speed` - Player movement speed (160)

**Methods:**
- `constructor(scene, x, y)` - Creates player sprite with physics properties
- `update(cursors)` - Handles player movement based on keyboard input
- `setPosition(x, y)` - Sets player position in the game world

### 3. GameMap Class (map.js)
Manages level layout, walls, collectibles, and exit point.

**Properties:**
- `scene` - Reference to game scene
- `tileSize` - Size of each tile (16px)
- `walls` - Static physics group for wall tiles
- `currentLayout` - Current level layout array
- `collectibles` - Static physics group for fire collectibles
- `totalCollectibles` - Counter for total fires in level
- `floorTiles` - Group for floor tile sprites
- `exitPos` - Exit tile coordinates
- `exitTile` - Exit sprite reference

**Methods:**
- `preload()` - Loads required tile assets
- `create(layoutKey)` - Initializes map components and physics
- `loadLayout(layout)` - Builds level from layout array
- `isAtExit(player)` - Checks if player is at exit position
